CSCI 599 Assignment 1 Programs :

1) Python Programs -
==================

Task 1 and 2 :- 

organizeFiles.py : 
----------------
This program classifies the files downloaded from the s3 bucket into their respective Mime-Types. The program does this classification by running Apache Tika on them. Files which are successfully parsed by tika are placed into an hierarchical directory structure according to their content- type. Files for which Tika gave exceptions are placed into an error directory.
Execution : 
$ python organizeFiles.py <path to S3 downloaded files directory> <path of destination directory>

Task 3 :-

Generate_Trec_Mime.py :
---------------------
This program parses the Json file present in https://github.com/chrismattmann/trec-dd-polar/ and generates a Json data for visualizing it using d3 pie chart
Execution :
$ python Generate_Trec_Mime.py <Path to new file> <path to trec json file>

Task 4 :-

BFA.py :
------
This program parses through all the files present in the directory of a particular mime type and outputs the signature as a json file.
Execution :
$ python BFA.py <Path to directory containing files> <output json file name>


Task 6 :-

FHT.py :
------
This program parses through all the files present in the directory of a particular mime type  and outputs the File header and trailer byte positions as a csv file.
Execution :
$ python FHT.py <path to directory containing files>

Task 7:-

countFiles.py:
-------------
This program counts the number of files present in each type and outputs the count as a json. This json file is further used to generate a d3 pie chart.
Execution :
$ python countFiles.py <root path of the directory containing all the mime types> <path for output json file>



2) D3 Scripts -
=============

Byte Frequency Analysis
-----------------------
BFA.html - 
Generates Interactive visualization of Byte Frequencies which are represented as bar graphs. The D3 takes as input the signatures generated from BFA.py.


File Header Trailer Analysis
----------------------------
fht.html -
Generates Interactive visualization of File header and trailers which are represented as a sparse matrix. The D3  takes as input the csv files generated by FHT.py. This script uses the library provided by Compass Inc for visualizing the data as matrix
Library: https://github.com/CompassInc/correlation-explorer.git

Visualization of TREC dataset
-----------------------------
Trec_Mime_Types.html -
Generates Interactive pie chart for visualizing the distribution of different mime types in the TREC dataset. The D3 takes as input a Json file which gives the frequency of occurences of each file under each mime type. The script uses the library provide by http://d3pie.org/ in generating the pie chart.
